<h1>Biography</h1>

<p>Hi, I am currently a computational physics PhD student at UIUC and a visiting student at UChicago.  I am a machine learning method developer, I developed methods to study molecular conformations and kinetics from simulation data. <a href="/research">Feel free to checkout this for my research projects.</a> </p>

<p>In addition to machine learning method development, I am also very interested in coding.  During my PhD, I have been an active contributor to open-source projects, including an enhanced sampling framework with native CUDA support, and a simulation plugin which has been merged into a widely-used package in my field. </p>
