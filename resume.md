**University of Chicago**, *PhD Researcher*, 08/2018-Present

- Created a deep learning based model to extract hierarchical slow modes from molecular time-series data ([GitHub](https://github.com/hsidky/srv))

- Achieved O(N) memory usage and O(N) time complexity, as opposed to O(N^2) memory usage and O(N^3) time complexity required by the state-of-the-art kernel based model

**University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign**, *PhD Researcher*, 05/2015 - Present

- Applied autoencoders with data augmentation to discover important collective variables for molecular systems

- Developed an enhanced sampling framework for molecular simulations  ([GitHub](https://github.com/weiHelloWorld/accelerated_sampling_with_autoencoder)), which enables orders of magnitude faster sampling than conventional techniques

- Built a neural network based force plugin for a simulation package with native CUDA support ([GitHub](https://github.com/weiHelloWorld/ANN_Force))

--------
## <span style="color: #397249">Teaching Experience</span>


- Taught lab and discussion sections for university physics courses for more than 400 engineering students in total, awarded "Excellent Teacher" 4 times out of 6 semesters

- Served as the mentor teaching assistant for one semester, organized peer evaluation and offered post-lecture feedback for new TAs
